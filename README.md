## - 💡 Project Intent
- I’m currently learning **RESTful API communication** with Spring and wanted to practice it in a way that’s both fun and practical. So, I decided to create a travel information sharing tool.

- **Why travel information sharing tool?** 
If you’ve ever been a travel guide or planned a trip with friends, you know the frustration all too well. You share flight schedules and all the trip details through KakaoTalk or WhatsApp, and then, the person who didn’t contribute much to the planning starts asking the same questions over and over again. Why? Because they don’t want to deal with the hassle of scrolling through the chat history to find the info.
But for you? **Answering those same questions repeatedly can quickly become super frustrating.**
To fix this, I am creating **a website where travel information can be shared easily and intuitively, eliminating the need for those endless, repetitive messages.**

No more digging through your inbox to find your flight details and then visiting airport websites to check live flight statuses. With this feature, you can view your flight schedule and real-time status all in one place.

## - 🔒 Limitations
- I managed data by hardcoding it into objects, with the intention of transitioning to a database once I gained the necessary knowledge.
